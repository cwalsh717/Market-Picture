    <!-- About Market Picture -->
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-50 mb-4">About Market Picture</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Market Picture is a daily market weather report. Open it up, see whether markets are in
      Risk-On, Risk-Off, or Mixed mode, read a short plain-English summary of what's happening,
      and get on with your day. Think of it like checking the weather — but for financial markets.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-12">
      No jargon walls. No paywalls. No signup required. Just a clear, data-driven snapshot of
      what's moving across stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, and crypto — updated throughout
      the day.
    </p>

    <!-- How It Works -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-50 mb-3">How It Works</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Market Picture pulls live data from across major asset classes — equities, interest rates,
      currencies, commodities, crypto, and more. It runs that data through a set of rules to
      determine the current market regime: are conditions generally favorable for risk assets,
      unfavorable, or somewhere in between?
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-12">
      Then, twice a day, AI generates a short narrative explaining what's happening and why — in
      plain English anyone can understand. No opinions, no predictions. Just the facts of what the
      data is showing.
    </p>

    <!-- Why I Built This -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-50 mb-3">Why I Built This</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      My name is Ciaran Walsh. I'm not a finance professional — I'm someone who's curious about
      markets and loves digging into data. I built Market Picture because I wanted a quick, honest
      read on what's happening across markets without having to piece it together from five
      different sources.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      It's also been an incredible way to teach myself agentic coding — building real software by
      working alongside AI tools. Every piece of this project, from the data pipeline to the
      frontend, has been a hands-on lesson in what's possible when you pair curiosity with modern
      dev tools.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-12">
      I love working on this. New features are rolling out constantly — I'm adding and tweaking
      things almost every day.
    </p>
